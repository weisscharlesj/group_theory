# Chemical Applications of Symmetry and Group Theory
This code serves to carry out various common tasks for the chemical application
of symmetry and group theory including the following features.
- Decompose reducible representations into irreducible prepresentations
- Generate reducible prepresentations based on number of stationary atoms in symmetry operations
- Predict IR and Raman active modes
- Generate symmetry adapted linear combinations (SALCs) of orbitals using the projection operator method or symmetry functions
